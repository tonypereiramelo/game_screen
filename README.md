# VIDEO SCREEN

#### Video demo: <URL>

#### Description: 
This app was developed in flutter by Igor Andrade and Tony Melo. We worked together in the same company and took the CS50 course to improve our knowledge.
We decided to make this final project in this format because the idea will be reused in a feature of the company we work for.
Basically, in the same app there is a screen responsible for uploading the bids of a recorded game to our database, a screen to organize and order these bids for the app user and another screen for the user to view these bids.
We mocked most of the data and made a simple interface, because the most important thing is the application's operating logic.
